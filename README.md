# Alphabet Recognition with Binary Encoding (A-Z)

This project demonstrates a simple neural network or ML model that recognizes alphabets (Aâ€“Z) using their binary visual representations. Each alphabet is encoded as a 5x6 binary matrix (flattened into 30 features), and mapped to a one-hot encoded label.

## ðŸ§  Project Structure

- **letters_binary**: A dictionary containing each letter (Aâ€“Z) as a 5x6 binary image.
- **x**: Input feature list where each element is a `(1, 30)` NumPy array representing a letter.
- **y**: Output labels using one-hot encoding, e.g., `A = [1, 0, 0, ..., 0]`, `B = [0, 1, 0, ..., 0]`, etc.

## ðŸ—‚ Data Format

Each letter is represented by a binary pattern (5 rows Ã— 6 columns = 30 bits):

```python
# Example:
letters_binary["A"] = [
    0,1,1,1,1,0,
    1,0,0,0,0,1,
    1,1,1,1,1,1,
    1,0,0,0,0,1,
    1,0,0,0,0,1
]
```

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements
### Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy
```
## ðŸš€ Usage
- Prepare the letters_binary dictionary for A to Z.

- Create the input and output datasets:

```python
x = [
    np.array(letters_binary["A"]).reshape(1, 30),
    np.array(letters_binary["B"]).reshape(1, 30),
    ...
    np.array(letters_binary["Z"]).reshape(1, 30),
]

y = [
    [1, 0, 0, ..., 0],  # A
    [0, 1, 0, ..., 0],  # B
    ...
    [0, 0, 0, ..., 1]   # Z
]
```
- Feed x and y into your model (MLP, logistic regression, etc.)

## ðŸ§ª Example Applications
- Simple handwritten character recognition.

- Basic neural network classifier testing.

- Educational use to understand image-to-vector conversion and one-hot labels
