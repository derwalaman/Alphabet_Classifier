# Alphabet_Classifier
A simple neural network built from scratch using NumPy to classify pixelated images of alphabets (A–Z). The model learns to recognize patterns in binary image data and predicts the correct letter based on learned weights. This project is a hands-on introduction to neural networks — with no machine learning libraries used.
